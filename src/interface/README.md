# Interface Layer

This directory contains components that interact with the outside world:

- Controllers: Handle HTTP requests
- Views: Presentation components
- API Endpoints: REST or GraphQL API definitions
- CLI Commands: Command-line interface implementations

The interface layer is responsible for translating between the application and external systems or users.
